# <CSS-Mod-One>

## Description

Fixed a website to algign with best practices for HTML semantic tags. I then updated and consolidated the CSS file to align with the new naming style. I also fixed the broken links within the website to move the user to the create part of the page when clinked. The goal was to make this website's code read easier and consolidate where possible. I learned about semantic strucutre as well as how to create wokring links

## Installation
